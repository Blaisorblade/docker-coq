This repository provides [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images of the [Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq) proof assistant.

These images are based on [this parent image](https://hub.docker.com/r/coqorg/base/), itself based on [Debian 9](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) and relying on [opam 2.0](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Manual.html).

See also the [docker-coq wiki](https://github.com/coq-community/docker-coq/wiki) for details about how to use these images.
